all these are the following ipythonnotebook files
1.multiclassify.ipynb (classifies the input data into and saves the model in a .h5 format)
2.realobjectdetection.ipynb(takes the input image and saves it as a model in a .h5 format containing  )
3.multiclasstest.ipynb(uses both these models and first classifies the image and then draws the bounding box for this)

PS:In each file change all the paths appropriately for the annotations and the jpeg folders which are present in the dataset downloaded from PASCAL VOC challenge
